             Nougat used a 9-patch to get round corners (even since Nougat, the 9-patch has used in
             text_edit_suggestion_container, but the color here basically draws a rectangle over
             it). specifying the background color should be skipped to match the original Holo
             theme, although this does deviate from the sharp corners in the Holo theme on more
             recent versions, which seems like a bug since it doesn't match either the original Holo
             theme or the Material theme. if there actually was a good reason to basically replace
             the 9-patch, it might be worth skipping the 9-patch even on Kitkat and remove it from
             text_edit_suggestion_container. since the style this inherits from has a background
             specified, we'll just replace it with a completely transparent one. -->
