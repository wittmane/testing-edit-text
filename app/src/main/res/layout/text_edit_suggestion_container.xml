<!-- (EW) from versions 24 (Nougat) through at least 31 (S / Android 12). prior to Nougat,
     Editor.SuggestionsPopupWindow#initContentView just created a new ListView from code, rather
     than using a layout file, but this was added presumably as a compatibility version for the Holo
     theme, so this wasn't actually the code used in the older versions. the code alternative from
     versions 21 (Lollipop) through 23 (Marshmallow) still matched this despite using the Material
     theme otherwise, but for better consistency with the theme generally and across versions of
     this app, this will only actually be in the Holo theme on those versions. see comment in
     Theme.Material in v21/themes. -->

    <!-- (EW) the ListView created from code on older versions (see above) got added as the content
         view for the PopupWindow, and it seems that only the layout params were specified, but more
         attributes are set here, which may be unnecessary, but since the AOSP version uses this for
         compatibility, it seems fine to leave unless there is a known issue with it. -->
